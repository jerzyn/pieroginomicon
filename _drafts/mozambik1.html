<p>I am back from my journeys. Back from the Baltics, Russia, Georgia and life on the go. But not to my previous life. Yesterday marks the beginning of a very exciting project for me. I have moved to Africa. To a small town of Manhiça just next to the capital of Mozambique. I will be living and working here for the next 5 months. A strange place for an IT person to go for work you say? For sure. But how exciting! I will be working here in a Health Research Center (CISM - Centro de Investigação em Saude de Manhiça) designing a new API layer on top of the current database systems.</p>



 what I hope to find here is not big money, disruption (grrr), etc. On the contrary. I want to help applying my professional skills in a place where it can, hopefully, change a bit more than just the size of one's pocket or the amount of work needed to upload a new photo to a social network. Don't get me wrong. These are perfectly fine motivations as well. Moreover I am in a comfortable enough position to be able to leave my good life in Europe, go to Africa and work in a health research center. </p>

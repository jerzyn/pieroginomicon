Hi everyone! I am back from Georgia and ready to share some stories. It did take quite a while but should be better from now on :) Without further ado 

Let's travel a little bit in time to the biking trip. As you might recall I have started the journey on 17th of August 2016. As I didn't really want to roam to much around the city of Lublin and its suburbs I took a train directly to the town of Łuków in the central-east part of Poland, some 100km from Lublin. The choice of town wasn't random as it lies fairly close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_River">Bug river</a> valley and I have a family there. So all in whole my real trip started a day after, 18th of August. My plan was to reach Janów Podlaski where is the most famous polish stables specialized in pure arabic breed horses. As it was the first day the distance wasn't really long either - merely 80km over a relatively flat land.

Hi everyone! I am back from Georgia and ready to share some stories. It did take quite a while but should be better from now on :) Without further ado 

Let's travel a little bit in time to the biking trip. As you might recall I have started the journey on 17th of August 2016. As I didn't really want to roam to much around the city of Lublin and its suburbs I took a train directly to the town of Łuków in the central-east part of Poland, some 100km from Lublin. The choice of town wasn't random as it lies fairly close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_River">Bug river</a> valley and I have a family there. So all in whole my real trip started a day after, 18th of August. My plan was to reach Janów Podlaski where is the most famous polish <a href="http://www.janow.arabians.pl/en/">stables specialized in pure arabic breed horses</a>. As it was the first day the distance wasn't really long either - merely 80km over a relatively flat land. A nice ride without unexpected adventures. I have arrived to Janów

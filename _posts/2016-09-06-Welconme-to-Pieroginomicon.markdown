Hello everyone and welcome to my new adventures - the "Pieroginomicon" blog. Or maybe more like an adventure about adventures themselves, as I would like to share here my most recent, but not only, endeavors in the world of travels, climbing/alpinism, my current projects, etc. The content will most likely be quite diverse and not every part will be interesting to everyone, but that's not the goal here. I will also be adding some additional features here like commenting and discussions platform, so that everyone who wants will be able to say express themselves. I hope you will enjoy dropping by here from time to time.

Cheers,
Andrzej
